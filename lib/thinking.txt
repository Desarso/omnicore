I have been thingking about how to get this project started, I need to fully set up nvim, with lazy vim, all of the harpoon and other functions, and the correct clues and autocomplete.
The reason I need that is because I want flutter in nvim to have the same really useful shortcuts that it has in vscode. Also I wanna see if I can get the nvim ssh to work, with the current devices nvim setup, ideally without needing to install anything in the host pc.
